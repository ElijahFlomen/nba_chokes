### NBA Chokes:

### By: Elijah Flomen & Blake Hartung

As avid sports fans, we wanted to conduct some sort of data exploration on the NBA. Specifically, this project seeks to investigate the causes and relationships regarding NBA games where a team that had a substaintial lead at one point of the game end up losing. These instances are known to be called 'chokes.' Basketball as a sport is extremely prone to large swings in the score and as a result, we thought it would be an interesting topic to investigate the potential reasons behind these choke endings. We hope you enjoye what we have created! It took hours of processing and thousands of API calls, so hopefully we have provided some insight.
