### NBA Chokes:

As avid sports fans, we wanted to conduct some sort of data exploration on the NBA. Specifically, this project seeks to investigate the causes and relationships regarding NBA games where a team that had a substaintial lead at one point of the game end up losing. These instances are known to be called 'chokes.' Basketball as a sport is extremely prone to large swings in the score and as a result, we thought it would be an interesting topic to investigate the potential reasons behind these choke endings.
