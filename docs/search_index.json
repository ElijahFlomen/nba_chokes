[["index.html", "NBA Chokes Chapter 1 Introduction", " NBA Chokes Elijah Flomen, Blake Hartung 2021-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction Overall viewership of basketball in the United States has skyrocketed over the last few years, most notably rising 34% from last season. Perhaps a driving factor for its demand has to do with the notion that basketball is a sport that is well known for its thrilling endings. Unlike sports such as American football or baseball where it is possible for a single team to hold possession of the game for long periods of time, basketball is unique in that the game flow is going through a constant start-and-stop pace, allowing for constant and rapid changes of possession. As a result of basketball’s inherent back-and-forth nature, it is not uncommon for a team to, at some point in the game, have a large probability of winning and then end up losing. In the sports community, if at any point a team has a high percentage of winning and then ends up losing a game, that is referred to as a ‘choke.’ For instance, in the context of basketball, if Team A leads Team B by 20 points going into the fourth quarter (12 minutes remaining) and then Team B ends up winning the game, this can likely be classified as a choke by Team A. Given the pace of basketball’s game flow, matches often result in chokes and we thought that it would be interesting to investigate the data behind to explain these upset endings. For instance, are there teams that are more ‘choke’ prone than others? Do teams tend to have more chokes when they play at home vs. when they are playing as a visitor? What are the most common reasons for a team to choke? Can we establish a categorical explanation for a choke, what mistakes did a team make for them to lose after such a large lead? Was it due to their fouls, missed shots, turnovers…? How do the individual player stats on a high choke team compare to league averages? Before we dive into the questions that guided our research, we also needed to make some subjective judgements regarding how we defined a choke. One of the most crucial of these decisions being to set the maximum win percent threshold to define a subsequent loss as a choke. For the purposes of this analysis, we determined to set this threshold value to be at 90%. Therefore, if at any point in a game, Team A had a 90% chance of winning the game, but the end result was a loss, then we categorized this event to be a choke for Team A. Throughout this entire analysis, we will reference such instances as ‘chokes’. Also, it must be noted that for each instance of a team who ‘choked’, their opponent also experienced a comeback. Given the symmetrical nature of these two occurrences, we will assume that for every time that Team A. choked against Team B, we will also conclude that Team B had a ‘comeback’ against Team A. This project will seek to provide an overview of statistical relationships between a range of variables, all focused around games with improbable endings in basketball, over the last four NBA seasons. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Githhub: ‘swar/nba_api’ Our central data source for this project came from a Python wrapper for the NBA’s public API. This API is written for Python and as a result a large portion of our data clearing and exporting came from Python scripts and notebooks (which will be discussed in more detail later). This API grants access to a wide variety of basketball-focused data, however, our project decided to narrow in on a few of its queries. Most importantly, we pulled the play-by-play data which provides a plethora of data at the moment-by-moment level of NBA games. Each row in this data set corresponds to an event in the game, which falls into 1 of 3 categories. An event can be neutral, such as the beginning and ending of a quarter, or events can favor either of the teams, such as a point scored, a foul committed, turnover etc. In addition to a string description of each event, each row in this data set also contains each team’s win probability at that moment in time which is already calculated by the NBA. Although we do not have the exact formula for how this crucial statistic is calculated, it is intuitively some function of point differential and time remaining in the game. This statistic is obviously critical for our analysis, since we are specifically looking at the games where a team had &gt;90% win probability at some point in time and then lost the game. We used this data set to initially pull every single game from the last 4 NBA seasons and identify the games where a ‘choke’ occurred. We also used this data set to pull specific player-related data, in particular, how their performance changed over the course of a game that was classified as a ‘choke’. Additional variables in this dataset include the time remaining in the current period and the scores of each team. More analysis of this dataset will be presented in our Missing values chapter. R Package: nbastatR In addition to the Python API to pull play-by-play and time-sensitive player data, we also leveraged the R package nbastatR. We used this data set to get aggregate seasonal data for specific players. We decided to use this data set since it allowed us to pull the data directly into R without needing external Python scripts. While the nba_api dataset does also have player statistics, it made more sense to keep this data in R, for easier formatting for subsequent visualization. This package provides R-access to data sets: NBA Stats API, Basketball Insiders, Basketball-Reference, HoopsHype, and RealGM. Depending on what type of statistic you are interested in finding, it will query one of these data sets. For the sake of our analysis, we will make most use of the NBA Stats API to get player statistics. This dataset contains both season-long as well as per-game stats on player performance metrics such as: season, points, assists, rookie status, turnovers, rebounds, player efficiency. Again, the package allows you to determine whether this data should be in a game-by-game basis or by season. We only used this data set to get seasonal player averages, which will be explained further in our Results. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data extraction and transformation process took substantial efforts throughout the course of this project. In order to identify all of the games where a ‘choke’ occurred over the last 4 NBA seasons, we needed to query over the data frames of all 30 teams, all of which play 82 games a season, surmounting to a total of 10,000 total games played. Further, we needed to then look at the event-level data of each of these games. In order to identify a ‘choke’, we checked to see if at any point during the if a team had a win probability &gt; 90% and then ended up losing the game. We used the nba_api’s play-by-play method to pull the event-level description of each game, including both team’s win probabilities at each moment. Once we identified an occurrence of a choke, we appended a row to a new data set, which will hold all of the instances of chokes. Each row of this newly created data set holds a unique game_id, the two teams who played, which of the teams was a home team vs. away team and finally which team choked. With this newly created data set, we are able to identify the number of times each NBA team choked as well as whether they were playing at home or as a visitor. This newly created data set is now ready to be exported from Python to R and used for analysis. The Python script that was used for this process can be found on our GitHub page, under PythonScripts/pull_chokes.py. Once we were able to identify the actual games that ended in a choke, we were interested in exploring the game-level data for these chokes. Therefore, for each game that was classified as a choke, we used its game_id (from our first data set) to make an additional query to the nba_api to get the entire game’s play-by-play data. This data extraction process now gives us the entire game description of each game that ended in a choke over the last 4 NBA seasons. Given that we only are concerned with examining the nuances of choke-ending games, we did not want to request data we did not need, and as a result only pulled the play-by-play data of the games we have already identified as chokes. However, we needed to conduct additional transformations on this data frame to make it more useful for our project. The main task was to convert each of the event_description strings to a single categorical variable. This transformation then allows for us to assign a potential explanatory reason for each choke that occurred. In its original form, the API gives us the description of the play-by-play data in the form of a sentence and we wanted to convert these sentences to a single respective variable, whenever applicable. To provide an example of this transformation, a play-by-play description from the source data set looked like: “MISS Finney-Smith 26’ 3PT Pullup Jump Shot” and we wanted to classify this row as simply a “miss”. Therefore, we parsed through the dataset’s event description data and classified each event into 1 of 3 categories: miss, foul, turnover. Given that these were the most frequent mistakes that a team will typically make and result in them losing, we looked to identify all of the moments in a game where any of these 3 occurrences took place. The Python script that was used for this process can be found on our GitHub page, under PythonScripts/form_pbp_data.py. Further, in our analysis, we thought it would be of interest to examine player-level statistics in games that ended as a choke. Therefore, we leveraged our access to the play-by-play data and parsed over all the event descriptions to split each player’s points into 2 categories: their points scored before the max win threshold and then the points scored after. This max win threshold is a crucial point in the game, since it is after this point where a team with a sizable lead begins to lose their momentum. This transformation would allow for us to model the difference in distributions of players points during a choke, split by the turning point in the game. We used the same nba_api play-by-play data’s event descriptions to determine which player is scoring at each moment of the game, whether or not their team ended up as the choke and if this point was scored before or after their max win threshold. Once this data set was split into players scores before and after the threshold point, it was relatively straightforward to overlay their density curves on a graph in R. The Python script that was used for this process can be found on our GitHub page, under PythonScripts/player_data.py In order to convert the player-specific data so that it can be used by R’s base mosaic plot, we required some reformatting of the data that we obtained via the nbastatR package. This package returns a data frame of data tables, all of which hold a season of statistics for a given player. As a result of this format, it was necessary to make use of pivot_longer in order to expand the player data for each input. Additionally, since this package returns data in a season-by-season basis, it was necessary to perform some data aggregation, to get the mean performance of each player, at each statistic, in long format. For our analysis, we only wanted to look at the players who were on a high-choke and high-comeback team and as a result, we simply hard coded their names into the request for their data, however, this package has much more dynamic capabilities if we were to do further data exploration or increase the interactive nature of our research. Since this player-specific data pulls from an extremely large data set, and this project makes a request to the API, if you are following along on your machine, it is possible that on your machine you may receive the following error in R: “The size of the connection buffer (131072) was not large enough”. If this is the case, simply increase the size of your buffer by running the following command: “Sys.setenv(”VROOM_CONNECTION_SIZE\"=131072*2)\". Additionally, there are some lines in our code that use hard-coded pathways to files. If you wish to reproduce our project on your own machine, be sure to identify them and update according to your working directory. While we did require some additional data transformations later on in the project, overall, these initial processes took up the majority of our time in getting our data reformatted in such a way to then be exported to R for further analysis. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Play-By-Play Data Set 4.2 Player Statistics Data Set (Steven Adams example)", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Play-By-Play Data Set There are no fully complete cases in our play-by-play data set. While this appeared troublesome at first, further analysis of the data set showed that these missing values are fairly intuitive. Most notably, there are 3 types of descriptions for (home description , away description, neutral description) for every moment in a game. Intuitively, in each row,only 1 of these values will be populated in the data set, aside from some exceptions. After looking through the data set, there are 2 specific cases in which there are both home and away descriptions: steal and turnover and shot attempt and blocked shot. Therefore, as we can see in our visualization of missing data, the “Neutral Description” variable is by far the least populated, which makes sense since there are very few reported neutral events in a game (such as: end of quarter 1, start of quarter 4…). However, as explained by the nature of home/visitor description, it is logical why these variables are also sparsely populated, due to their relatively mutually exclusive nature. As we can see by the top 2 patterns of missing data, we can see a strong presence of 2 out of these 3 data points missing for a high number of observations. As a result, we will end up merging these 3 columns into a single “description” variable, which will simply describe the play and will not be organized by home/away/neutral. This merged column will not contain missing values. The only other notable pattern of missing data can be seen with the HOME_PCT and VISITOR_PCT columns, each respectively representing the home and visitor win probabilities. Win probability is a crucial aspect of our analysis, and in our data set, we noticed that no win probabilities for either team are reported past the 5 minute mark in the 4th quarter. It is for this reason that the “HOME_PCT” and “VISITOR_PCT” also contain the next largest count of missing data. Due to this, we will not consider any win probabilities past this point in the game. However, given that our main research question is to investigate the reasons for a game that ends in an upset, the 5 minute mark in the 4th quarter is a reasonable time of the game to consider as a cut off point. Therefore, it must be made clear that throughout our project, we are only able to identify games as ‘chokes’ when a team had a greater than 90% win probability, prior to entering the final 5 minutes of the game. Naturally, we have no issue with this restriction on our data set since the last minutes seconds of a game can perhaps be extremely volatile, or a team has already secured a large enough lead to make a comeback impossible. As a result, these observations would be naturally excluded since they likely skew our data. As a result, our chokes can be interpreted as instances when a team has a sizable lead at some point in the game prior to the final 5 minutes, and then subsequently loses. Other than these 2 important metrics, every other column is completely populated, since they contain data such as the time and points scored for each team, which can logically be reported at every instance of the game. 4.2 Player Statistics Data Set (Steven Adams example) For the player-specific statistics, there contains some records of missing data. It is most likely that some of these statistics require minimum numbers of games played / shots attempted for them to be recorded. For example, if a player shoots a single 3 pointer in his career and it is successful, he should not hold the NBA all time record for highest 3 point percentage, at 100%. As a result, there are certain players whose statistics are missing for this reason of small sample size. Given that there is no clear pattern for these missing values, our solution was simply to ignore those values when getting player averages, since that is consistent with how the NBA would rank players. We present here an example of a player profile, Steven Adams with some missing statistics. As can be seen by Adams statistics throughout his seasons in the NBA, there are 5 rows where he is missing his pctFGRank, which is his field goal shooting %. This is the only pattern of missing data in his player set, as well as others. As mentioned earlier, for a player to have this stat missing is logical. Adams sustained several injuries over the last few years and it is likely that there were seasons where he did not take enough shot attempts to have a recorded pctFGRank. Every other statistic, however, is filled since those are all for actual counts and not a percentage. The same can be seen for most other players in our data set that we got from nbastatR.

Comeback 5.4 Reasons for Choke 5.5 Player Stat Heat Maps 5.6 League-Wide Game Split Data 5.7 MEM and OKC Game Split Player Data", " Chapter 5 Results To begin our analysis, it seemed logical to first gain a sense of which teams have recorded the most total chokes, as well as comebacks over the last 4 seasons. As a result, we used a Cleveland Dot plot to display a ranking of these teams. 5.1 Total Chokes and Comebacks It is interesting to note here initially the top 5 choke teams as: Memphis, Minnesota, Miami, New Orleans, Charlotte and the top 5 comeback teams as Oklahoma City, Boston, Denver, Toronto and Los Angeles. This initial plotting showed us that there are indeed some teams who have experienced considerably more chokes than others, and as a result, we can investigate some of the variables that can potentially be explaining why certain teams have higher choke v. comeback rates. 5.2 Choke and Comeback Relationship To begin, it should be noted that while there is an apparent negative relationship between a team’s number of chokes and comebacks, this relationship is not entirely mutually exclusive. The scatter plot below shows a pretty evident negative correlation between these two variables, which is to be expected. A team who is great at making comebacks should subsquently be a team that does not often choke. Nonetheless, this initial data visualization showed that it is possible that a team can lie in both categories. A team can be simply extremely volatile (or stable) once they have secured a 90% (or fallen to a 10%) win probability, however the direction of that volatility is not consistent. Although there is no overlap within the top 5 teams in each category, it would be useful to determine if certain teams are just extremely volatile in both direction, given a sizable lead or disadvantage. Some interesting findings from this scatter plot is that there are indeed some teams with notable volatility (and stability) in their game play and this scatter plot has allowed us to identify some of these outliers.For instance, Charlotte, a team we already identified to be within the top 5 choke teams also has a sizable number of comebacks. Further, Denver, a team that ranked in the top 5 comeback teams, was also within the top half of choke-prone teams. As a result, these two teams stand out in that for both of them, relative to the rest of the league, their games often result in improbable endings, for better and for worse. Atlanta also stands out in this plot in that they are a team with a very low level of chokes, relative to their number of comebacks. Therefore, it would be of interest to investigate further aspects of these teams that cause them to stand out as improbable ending prone teams. Additionally, it was not surprising to notice that the number 1 team in both chokes and comebacks, MEM and OKC respectively, both ranked among the lowest in their respective opposite category. 5.3 Home v. Visitor impact on Choke v. Comeback Given these top teams in both choke and comeback categories, we wanted to investigate whether or not being the home vs. visitor team was a significant determinant of the outcome of the game. In the sports community, it is often known that home teams typically have a slight advantage, however, we wanted to investigate the nuances of this advantage at the choke vs. comeback level. For all teams across the league, we have produced mosaic plots to get a visual representation of this potential relationship. We split the league in half, by alphabetical order just to have the graph not be overly crowded and to view the relationship more clearly. As we can see from the following two mosaic plots, most teams exhibit significant differences between their number of chokes and comebacks when they are home vs. when they are a visitor. What was most surprising from this visualization was that a vast majority of teams have a much higher comeback rate when they are a visitor. While most teams have this trend, teams such as DET and TOR show a strong positive relationship between them experiencing a comeback and being a visitor team. Perhaps a logical explanation for this finding is that home teams do a better job than visitors of starting the game off strong, using the crowd and familiar environment to their advantage. As a result, many of the instances of comebacks for a team occur when they are a visitor, simply due to the fact that a home team has a better chance of gaining an early lead. However, as the game progresses, the initial boost of energy that a home team may have taken advantage off to get started wears off, leading to a choke endin. On the flip side, for these same teams, they had much more chokes as home teams than as visitors. Along the same logic, this can likely be interpreted as home teams having the advantage of starting off a game very strong, but as a result, lends itself to the possibility of a choke in the latter part of the game. This finding was extremely curious to us since it caused us to question the true nature of having home-court advantage. However, given that this data set is only considering the games that had a choke/comeback ending, this seemingly contradictory relationship is actually quite logical. Home advantage simply allows the team playing in their home court to start the game off strong, which creates a scenario where a choke is potentially possible. 5.4 Reasons for Choke Now, given that there is some explanatory connection between being home vs. away and the outcome of a team’s game, we wanted to leverage the play-by-play data to see the most frequent events in a game that resulted in a choke. This analysis would enable us to assign a single cause to a choke instance and then examine holistically which of these causes are most common, split by home chokes vs. away chokes. We decided that a fair metric to determine the single cause for a choke would be to identify the event with the maximum standardized frequency. As mentioned earlier, the main 3 mistakes that a team makes which leads them to a choke include: misses, fouls and turnovers. However, it would be naive to simply count the frequencies of these events in a choke and then assign the event with the largest count to be the explanatory mistake. This is because in a game, naturally some of these events will occur more often than others, regardless of the final game outcome. To fix this, we looked at the ratio of the counts of each mistake, relative to the total league averages. We obtained these league averages from this website. Since we standardized the frequencies of each mistake to the league average, we can then identify the mistakes that occurred at the largest multiple, against the league average. As an example, if the number of fouls in a game is around 10, if a team commits 20 fouls, it is likely that since they committed 2x of the league average, their abundance of fouls was the main contributor for their choke. We used a bar chart to display the distribution of games that has misses, fouls or turnovers as their main explanatory variable. As we can see here, the clear leading cause for both home and away chokes are turnovers. Given that turnovers are the clear leading causes for chokes over the last 4 seasons, it would be of interest to investigate the turnover rates of specific players in the NBA, which will follow in our analysis. An additional interesting finding is that, for home chokes, misses are more frequent than fouls, but the opposite is true for away chokes. Therefore, fouls had a larger presence than misses for team to choke, when they are playing as a visitor. 5.5 Player Stat Heat Maps Now that we have identified the teams with the highest chokes / comebacks, as well as the most frequent causes for these outcomes, it would be of interest to dive into some of the player-specific statistics. Given that fouls, misses, turnovers are all the cause of players’ specific actions, it would be of good use to visualize these, as well as other individual player-level statistics. This investigation would allow us to determine if, for high-choke teams, the main reasons for their unfortunate endings are the result of one specific player, or rather the team as a whole performing poorly in a specific category. The highest-choke team in our data set was found to be The Memphis Grizzlies, therefore, it would be interesting to further explore their individual players’ statistics. Symmetrically, we also wanted to visualize the individual player-level statistics of the highest comeback team, the Oklahoma City Thunder. A natural way to express player-level data is in the form of a heat map, showing the average ranking of that player in that statistic, over the course of their career. Given that players are often moved around teams, there is no perfect system to determine their statistics, filtered down to only the games when they played for a specific team, however, we simply decided to look at the individual player statistics who were most frequently on that team during their chokes/comebacks. This seemed like the most logical approach to solve the issue of inconsistent rosters, since we are looking at the player career stats of individuals who played on frequently choke / comeback teams. Heat plots of both team’s average player rankings in the following categories are: ptsRank = overal points Ranking fgmRank = field goals made Ranking pctFGRank = fileld goal % ranking fg3mRank = 3 pointers made ranking trebRank = total rebound ranking tovRank = turnover ranking (lower ranking means more turnovers) From the Memphis Grizzlies heatmap, we can clearly see that Ja Morant, their starting point guard ranks very high regarding total turnovers, which we found to be a leading cause in a team to choke. As a result, it is likely that his high turnover rate could be a contributor to the Grizzlies high choke rate. Morant ranks very high in turnovers according to his tovRank cell, and since turnovers are a negative stat, a higher rank indicates his costly mistakes. In addition to Morant’s high turnover rate, this visual also clearly shows that Anderson as well as Jackson rank relatively low with respect to a range of their offensive statistics. However, interestingly enough, Memphis, while still being the leading team for chokes, has some players (including Morant) rank pretty well regarding their overall shooting scoring and rebounding statistics (with the exception of Valanciunas and Gasol’s fg3mRank). This conclusion, while seemingly contradictory is actually quite intuitive. In order for a team to choke, they must have at some point in the game, been leading by a considerable amount. Therefore, Memphis should have pretty solid player statistics if they are able to consistently gain a sizable lead in a game. As a result, it makes sense that high-choke tendency teams, such as Memphis, happen to have players that rank pretty well regarding their aggregate offensive statistics. In order to juxtapose the player statistics of a high choke team to a high comeback team, we wanted to examine the same type of visual, however for the 5 players who had a large presence on the Oklahoma City Thunder, the most frequent comeback team from 2017 - 2021. From OKC’s player statistics, we can see they have some extremely strong performers, relative to Memphis. This finding should be straightforward, since a high comeback team surely needs to have efficient offensive players on their roster. On this team, we can see very consistently strong offensive statistics (with the exception of Adams’ fg3mRank). Oklahoma City’s high level of comebacks can be interpreted very clearly here by their players demonstrating strong offensive performances. While the heat map was able to confirm our initial thoughts on the performance of players on high comeback teams, it left us unsatisfied with its representation of high choke teams, such as Memphis. As mentioned, this misleading representation stems from the fact that in order for a team to choke, they were capable of initially gaining some sort of lead.Therefore, perhaps aggregate season-level data can begin to paint the picture of a choke-prone team, it is perhaps not most optimal method to identify if specific players are acting as significant contributors to a team’s choke or comeback. 5.6 League-Wide Game Split Data Given that we are able to identify the specific moment in a game when a team begins to lose their lead and begin their choke, it would be valuable to visualize players points before and after the point of max win probability in the game. As a result, in our efforts to further investigate if we can identify choke-reasons at the player level, we managed to split our play-by-play data into before and after the choke turning point in a game. We define this turning point as the moment when the team who ended up choking had its highest overall win percentage. We wanted to initially look at the aggregate distributions of player scores before and after their team began to ‘choke.’ The overall distribution is as follows: Clearly, from a league wide perspective, we can see a very notable drop off in the points scored for a player, after their point of max win probability. From this visual, we can see there is a significant peak at the value 0, meaning that a majority of players are scoring 0 points after this turning point in their choke games. However, what is interesting about this visual is that there is a bi modal shape the the ‘after turning point’ density curve, with an initial peak of 0 and then another one at around the ~2 point mark. As a result of this shape of the density curve, it caused us to question whether there are individual players who may be still performing (relatively) well, while the rest of their team performs poorly. Given that there is still a significant portion of players with non-zero scores after the turning point, perhaps there are certain players who still perform well after the turning point, yet it is their teammates who are dragging them down for a loss and a choke. As a result, we wanted to provide a similar visual of points scored before and after the choke turning point, however, on a player-specific level. This visualization would enable us to conclude if it is truly teams as a whole who choke, or if there are specific players whose poor performance in the latter portion of the game drags the whole team down. 5.7 MEM and OKC Game Split Player Data As we can clearly see from these faceted graphs, there are a few notable players who perform especially poorly following the game’s turning point. Take Anderson for instance, who typically scores 5-10 points prior to his team’s peak win probability, followed by a strong amount of 0-2 point performances. A similar trend can be seen for Jackson, as well as Valancuinas. However, it is interesting to note that Gasol and Morant, while they do perform poorly, do not perform as badly, relative to their teammates. Both of these players have significant peaks at non-zero values in their “Points After” curves, hence indicating that they often continue to score, while at the slower pace than before, but still at a greater rate than their teammates. Therefore, Memphis’ player-specific game-split data indicates that the team’s poor performance is potentially the product of a few sub-par players. This therefore sheds light on one of our initial discussions of whether or not a choke is a team or an individual effort, and through these graphs we can see that there is some significant argument that chokes may be the product of individual-level poor performances. To conclude our analysis, we wanted to see if the flip side of the previous finding was true; are comebacks largely explained by the excellent performance of a subset of players on high-comeback teams? To find out, we produced the same visualization, however, this time for the players we analyzed on OKC, the team with the most comebacks in our data set. Interestingly enough, it can be seen here that there is no true distinction across individuals players performances on OKC. During comebacks, players OKC, generally perform relatively consistently, before and after their games’ turning point. With the exception of Adams, whose graph appears distorted due to a long strain of injuries he sustained, the players density curves follow relatively similar trends before and after the game turning point. When compared with the players of MEM during their choke games, the OKC players during their comeback games perform fairly consistently throughout the game. As a result, the true nature of a comeback team possibly comes as an entire team effort. Fun fact: While over the last 4 seasons, the Memphis Grizzlies have been the highest choke team and the Oklahoma City Thunder have been the highest comeback team, on December 2nd, 2021, Memphis beat Oklahoma city 152-79, breaking the all time NBA record for largest win margin of all time. Therefore, Memphis being a high choke team does not mean they are not capable of winning games (by massive margins), rather they simply are inconsistent at keeping the pace going on games where they start off strong. On the flip side, just because OKC has performed well as a comeback team, relative to the rest of the league, this does not mean that they are performing solidly throughout the season. Given that they often put themselves into situations where they face a mere 10% chance of winning, their team surely can use some improvements moving forward. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Description: The data below is from NBA Playoff Games from 2017-2018 where one team has “choked” as we have described extensively throughout our project. The data is interactively selected to each playoff game requested, and the following mosaic-like bar chart comes on screen: Reading the chart - The data is split up on each side of the mosaic first by team, followed by shade as follows: Home Team. Top 3 Scorers Home Team. All Other Scorers Visiting Team. Top 3 Scorers Visiting Team. All Other Scorers The height of the plot is represented by the % of points scored by each category before and after the inflection (or choke) point.Therefor, the addition of all scorers then will ad up to 1.0 for before choke and after choke, respectively. This kind of data gives an insight into why a team may have choked/ made a comeback. For example, the game that automatically comes up is MIA @ BOS. Before the inflection point, Boston’s Top 3 players scored much more than they did after the inflection, and in a similar manner, Miami’s bottom players before the choke ended up playing a significant role in the second part of the game. svg { margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block; } "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Overall, this project shed light on many of the explanatory variables and relationships for choke-prone and comeback-prone NBA teams. Some notable conclusions include the nature of away teams having far more comebacks than home teams, which largely countered our initial thinking coming into the project Further, it was interesting to note that the ordering of reasons for chokes differ for chokes that occur on a home court vs. away. Specifically, home teams choke more often due to misses, and away teams choke more often due to fouls. Perhaps there is something about the familiarity of a home area or the energy from a crowd that causes players to make these different mistakes when playing in different locations. Further, from a player-level standpoint, we noted that choke-prone teams’ aggregate players statistics do not by any means stand out as overtly negative (shown in MEM player heat map). However, comeback-prone teams do happen to have aggregate player statistics that are relatively strong (shown in OKC player heat map). In order to better flesh out the negative performance of the choke-prone team players, looking at their points before and after a game’s turning point was much more telling than their overall season statistics. Additionally, on Memphis, we saw that while all players perform poorly during a choke, some perform notable worse than others. As a result, its possible that chokes are partially the result of individuals performances. However, for the comeback team, OKC, we saw that comeback efforts are the product of the positive performance of the entire team and it is not the product of a consistent single player. Having had more time for this assignment, there are some aspects that could have received more attention. Namely, it we likely should have paid closer attention to in-game injuries when we split the data on pre and post game turning point. After seeing the shape of Adams’ distribution curve, it occurred to us that we are likely including the performance of players during games when they may have exited early, or been limited due to injury. Further, it would have been a rewarding addition to have made the choke-threshold value vary throughout our analysis.
