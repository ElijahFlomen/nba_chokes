### NBA Chokes:

This project seeks to investigate the causes and relationships for NBA games where a team that had a substaintial lead at one point of the game ended up losing. Basketball as a sport is extremely prone to large swings in the score and as a result, we thought it would be an interesting topic to investigate.
